I haven’t written much at all before, I don’t consider myself exceptionally well-read, and my views are not as polished as I would like them to be, but I felt as though there was something important to be said here. I’ve been a bit fed-up with ableism in leftist (whatever that means anymore) spaces, and have had some growing thoughts on anxiety & bravery, the feminine & the masculine, etc. I hope this is good enough to get my point(s) across, and I will likely revisit this at a later date once I feel more comfortable writing & have become more well-rounded with politics.

<h2>0. Introduction</h2>
<p class="tab">
As long as the culture of machism has bred itself into society, breeding the binaries of gender and weaving cisheteropatriarchy through technocapital, we have found an ever-increasing societal discouragement of things seen as feminine. This femicide takes place ━obviously━ in the literal, but has perhaps more actively taken place in the metaphorical, where any signs of femininity are snuffed out as quick as they show up. Female has long bore the title of the scared and weak gender, so much so that most common synonyms for wimpishness all bear female titles and origins (pussy, sissy, mama’s boy, etc.). This ━furthermore and in tandem with Capitalism’s bloodthirst for constant work regardless of mental condition━ has manifested itself in a cultural hatred for weakness, anxiety, and depression. There is much to say about this in relation to the acceleration towards femininity in general, but you’re much better off reading about that elsewhere (see: Zeroes & Ones, The G/Acc Blackpaper, etc.).

People are more terrifed than ever, and they have a right to be. Everything’s dying, the world’s getting hotter, trans folk are being targeted via a fictional culture-war more than ever before (which was amped up initially by a more broad liberal acceptance of transness, and then by an even more liberal dismissal of anti-trans action), work is more demanding, school is more demanding, we’re running out of everything we need to survive, etc. We have seen mental conditions worsen starting with the industrial revolution’s movement forward and with technocapital’s global growth, and have furthermore seen an increase in machism (which I would consider to be one of the many death-rattles of cis-maleness and patriarchy) & a general distaste for the anxious and depressed ━especially in the workforce (see: <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/karoshi-japan-overwork-culture">karoshi</a>)━ even among leftist groups & camps of thought (I cannot count the amount of times I have seen revolutionaries make thoughtless jokes about ’gen-z’s’ issues with anxiety). Clearly we are facing an enemy that has us cornered on nearly every front, which is where the fear comes in.

<h2>1. Power in Misery</h2>
<p class="tab">
Fight-or-flight is possibly the most absolute bare-bones response of any semi-conscious creature that we have ever known; it is the original do-or-fucking-die, and it’s been totally ingrained into human function. Those who have perceptually mastered the fight response (i.e. those who would be considered brave and do not visually deal with anxiousness and fear) are typically seen as the biological winners of biology’s game and represent the pinnacle of masculinity, but the percieved is not the only element here. The anxious, (not explicitly literal, but also literal) transfeminine bodies who are typically percieved as those in flight responses are just as much fighting as are the un-flinching macho-men of cisheteropatriarchy’s wet dreams, just in an entirely seperate fashion. Every battle through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180326080008/http://www.xenosystems.net/imitation-games/">Imitation Games</a> (both for the transgenders and autistics), every breakdown after another grueling week of work, every ’um’ and ’ah’ in a stuttery barely-muttered sentence, every fucking survival against the world’s terror is a fight won. Are those faggots, trannies, and retards who are barely surviving each and every day not as ━if not more━ brave than the neurotypical cishet men who power through each and every single interaction that they have? Are the ’weak’ not engaging in an anxiety-driven guerilla against Capitalism’s fascist stronghold over every single aspect of life? I don’t think that the difference between fight or flight is all that different now, nor has it ever been; they are both self-preservation tactics resulting in the same outcomes throughout biology. The only real difference is that fight has typically been an oppressive move, and that flight has been a direct tactic of self-preservation so that the creature may recoup later. Colonialism has been the ’fighting’ oppressive move made by Capitalism in order to push a top-down system– but as you already should know, we are trending towards bottom-up horizontal systems, and this is no different.

To quote Nyx, <i>"Gender is a hyperstition overlayed on sex by the male. Its function is to objectify the female and impose on her a social function as a machine whose duty is to reproduce the human, always in the service of the male, who alone has no future and must have sons to pass his legacy onto. It is a primordial dynamic of order and chaos, centralization and decentralization, strong singular individualism and command-and-control versus high degrees of networking and the potential for swarming. As a hyperstition, it is not real, but is not unreal; it is rather a fiction that makes itself real"</i> (<a href="https://vastabrupt.com/2018/10/31/gender-acceleration/">Nyx</a>). The same can be said for the attributes applied to the female; weakness was assigned to it, and so became it. A message I see in the Blackpaper -–although obviously not a praxial work-– is not to be ashamed of these ’inferior’ feminine aspects, but to utulize them as a force of negation. I think that the bravest a person could ever be is to be terrified of everything, but to keep pressing on. This does not mean to lose yourself to fear or to demonize strength & bravery as they are commonly understood, but to adopt a widened understanding of them & realize that there is potential in fear. Mental health is and will forever be a political issue; we will still be anxious & depressed after the war is won, but the major factor creating our torment is Capitalism.

Do not shun your weakness and terror, weaponize it. Lesbovampyric anxiety will tread through and plow over the hyper-masculine and it’s despotic top-down systems of control. Anxious transsexual shooters and depressed micro-insurgents; terrified voodoo antihumanists and shizophrenic xenofeminists; these are the people that are going to win out through the gender-shredder and flow through technocapital. <a href="https://crueltysquad.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Mechanics#Power_In_Misery">Power in misery.</a>
